Lispy is a very simple Scheme interpreter with support for Python-like
comprehensions and polymorphic basic procedures.  The main goal of Lispy is 
to provide a simple implementation that illustrates the concepts behind 
programming language constructs without focusing at all on efficency or error
handling.

Lispy is based on Bootstrap Scheme by Peter Michaux:
http://michaux.ca/articles/scheme-from-scratch-introduction

If you are trying to learn how to write an interpreter I highly recommend you
read his Scheme From Scratch series as much of the basic functionality of 
Lispy is based on his code.

A test suite has been provided to verify basic functionality (though not 
edge-cases) and to provide a form of limited documentation.  I strongly 
suggest that you don't use Lispy for real-world applications.  Lispy should 
run fine as long as you give it valid code (provided all the tests pass).





**=============================================**
** Installing Lispy
**=============================================**

Lispy depends on the Hans-Boehm Garbage Collector in /usr/include/gc
This should do the trick in Ubuntu $ sudo apt-get install libgc-dev 

After checking out the project, cd into the directory and type:

$ make
$ ./lispy

Testing...
Unit Test Completed Successfully
> 


If all goes well you will be greeted with this screen.
The unit tests should report any errors if there are any.

Lispy has been tested on 32 and 64 bit Ubuntu.  If you are having problems 
installing you can email me at jacktradespublic AT gmail DOT com.





**=============================================**
** Documentation
**=============================================**

The main form of documentation for Lispy is the unit tests and source code
comments.  Both, unfortunately, are unsuitable as real documentation, 
however Lispy is hardly a production system.

The Pointless Programming Reference at plr.sourceforge.com will also contain 
some documentation for Lispy.





**=============================================**
** Files Included with Lispy
**=============================================**

** lispy.c
The main source file for Lispy.  This is technically all you need.

** unit_tests.lispy
The Lispy test suite, run by default every time Lispy is loaded.

** Makefile
A simple one-line makefile

** lispy_logo.txt
A simple ASCII art logo for the Lispy launch screen.

** licence.txt
GNU Affero General Public License version 3 header and credit to Peter Michaux.

** syntax_highlighting/lispy.xml  AND  chicken.xml
Syntax highlighting files for the Kate text editor for Lispy and Chicken Scheme.
Put these in your katepart syntax folder.
In Ubuntu the directory is located at: /usr/share/kde4/apps/katepart/syntax
Only for Kate development.  I don't know what your IDE will do with Lispy!
